    <div class="column"> I usually have four meals a day. In the morning I have breakfast. At school I have lunch. At
        home I have dinner and in the evening I have supper. Besides, I like to eat an apple or a banana, or to drink a
        glass of juice between meals, if I’m thirsty.

        Yesterday I got up at 7 o’clock, washed, cleaned teeth and dressed. Then I had breakfast. I had mashed potatoes
        with meat, a cheese sandwich and a cup of tea for breakfast. At school we had a pie and a glass of orange juice.
        I’m always hungry when I come home after school. Yesterday my mother, cooked cabbage soup, roast chicken and
        rice, made pudding and tea. It was so tasty. I ate everything with pleasure.
